# What is SOXS?

SOXS is a software suite which can create simulated X-ray observations of
astrophysical sources with almost *any* existing or planned X-ray observatory. The goal of
SOXS is to provide a comprehensive set of tools to design source models and
convolve them with simulated models of X-ray instruments. This package was developed to support the
[*Lynx X-ray Observatory*](https://www.lynxobservatory.org) mission concept.

There are two main entry points to SOXS: a command-line interface, and a
Python interface. The former is simpler to use, but the latter has more power
and flexibility. Both of these entry points are extensively documented with
examples.

# Installing SOXS

SOXS and its dependencies are installed as a standard Python package, and it is compatible
with Python 3.x. You may use `pip` to install it (if you do not have pip, check
that your executable is not named `pip3`, otherwise visit https://pip.pypa.io/ to download
it):

```
[~]$ pip install soxs
```

If the Python distribution is not "owned" by you on your machine you might have to call
`sudo pip install soxs`. If you need to upgrade from a previous version of SOXS, issue
`[sudo] pip install -U soxs` from the command line. 

If you use [Anaconda Python](https://www.continuum.io/anaconda-overview), you may
install SOXS using `conda`:

```
[~]$ conda install -c jzuhone soxs
```
NOTE: Currently, there is no Anaconda package for [regions](https://astropy-regions.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) on Python 3.10, which is a SOXS dependency. It must be installed via pip.

These methods install both the Python interface and the command-line scripts.

Alternatively, to install into your Python distribution from [source](http://github.com/XRStools/soxs):

```
[~]$ python setup.py install
```
